# Traffic Impact & Calming Projects

• Traffic Impact and Calming Projects                            09/2024  
  Assessed mixed-use traffic impacts and evaluated traffic-calming strategies in Los Angeles, Chicago, and Miami.

## Overview
This repository unifies a comprehensive review of traffic calming methods with a full traffic impact study for a proposed mixed-use development. It shows how field data, forecasting, capacity analysis, and context-appropriate calming tools can reduce speeds, improve safety, and support more livable streets—while navigating funding, public acceptance, and maintenance constraints.

## Study Areas & Case Studies
- Los Angeles — speed humps and chicanes  
- Chicago — traffic circles and road diets within Vision Zero  
- Miami — raised crosswalks in pedestrian-heavy corridors  
- Project site — Castle Drive, Jones Avenue, Main Street influence area

## Objectives & Methods
- Estimate **AADT** using traffic counts and seasonal adjustment factors  
- Analyze **AM/PM peak-hour** volumes and turning movements  
- Compute **trip generation** with the **ITE Trip Generation Manual**  
- Distribute trips directionally based on **TAZ** populations and network logic  
- Combine existing + projected volumes to assess **capacity/LOS**  
- Evaluate **calming strategies** (speed humps, chicanes, road diets, circles, raised crosswalks) for safety and livability outcomes  
- Recommend **mitigation** (near-term operations; long-term multimodal and transit upgrades)

## Key Findings
- The proposed development significantly increases peak-hour volumes; **PM peak** exceeds capacity at critical intersections  
- **Near-term:** targeted lane widening and **signal optimization** improve operations  
- **Long-term:** **multimodal** enhancements (complete streets, transit support) strengthen network resilience  
- Calming tools reduce speeds and conflicts but require **community buy-in**, adequate **funding**, and clear **maintenance** plans

## Repository Structure
- **/docs** — Final reports (Traffic Impact Study PDF, Traffic Calming Review PDF)  
- **/data** — Counts, seasonal factors, TAZ inputs, spreadsheets  
- **/figures** — Charts, maps, and visuals  
- **/scripts** — (Optional) analysis/processing helpers
